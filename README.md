## 1. Project Description

For our frontend project, we were tasked with creating the client-side for another group's backend project (API). We were assigned the bookkeeper API which is a book inspired API, where users could add a book the main booklist which came with app to their personal booklist. They could also categorise each book into three categories: To read, reading and read. A filter function also allowed users to filter books based on the author, genre and rating. 

Other functionalities include adding a new book and new user, updating a user's personal details and deleting a user account.

### Wireframe

Our wireframe displays what we originally intended our website to look like. We have the different sections - home, our books, update account details and sign in, and then the 'to-read', 'reading' and 'read' comes under the user account section. In our final product, we decided to not include images of the books for a more sleeker look, however, the rest of the design was almost identical to our finished product.
